# ()

> function() { } defines a javascript function as is obvious. Surrounding it with () makes it an expression. Following it with () executes it.

# IIFE

> The grouping operator consists of a pair of parentheses around an expression or sub-expression to override the normal operator precedence so that expressions with lower precedence can be evaluated before an expression with higher priority. As it sounds, it groups what's inside of the parentheses.
